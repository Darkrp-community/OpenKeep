//Note: The template DM (like this file) should be included (checkmarked) in DM!
//The map files themselves (.dmms) should NOT be included, just placed anywhere.
//For ease of file management, the dmms can be placed in a subfolder (in this case "lil_bog_shack")


//First, set the landmark so it can be easily placed
//Note: You can place multiple of the same map mark, it will pick and load them multiple times just fine
//Other note: Loading a .dmm will overwrite whatever was on the tiles but will not delete objects, so clear an area of trees etc in the area you want to make.
