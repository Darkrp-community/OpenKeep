TO TILL THE SOIL
&quot;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>

Tilling the soil is best done with a hoe or a plough. Doing it twice gives deeper furrows and makes your plot more durable. Simply drag the plough along to do the work.
</p><p><br></p><p>

To feed the soil, a compost bin can be made and filled with apple cores and sundry vegetables. Compost needs time to mull, and use your hand or a shovel to turn it before it can be used.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Threshes can be made with some wood and a rope, and with some metal fittings turned to a deadly weapon.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Use of a pitchfork makes carrying wheat and oat stalks faster.
