Sewing requires a needle, cloth and fibres. This arte is most useful for common clothing and padding, fancy hats may require a feather as well.

Weaving requires a loom and silk.  Sometimes fibres and cloth may be needed to complete your work. You can make padded gambesons with plenty of cloth, or more exotic clothing such as bathrobes or a royal cloak by adding fur, and some religious masks by adding a silver ingot.

Leatherworking requires a drying rack and a needle, using furs and hide to make a variety of clothing and armor. Some may need the head of an animal.
