I wonder… do you dream of things you cannot comprehend?
Honor is not earned on the battlefield, but here I am to prove otherwise.
The field of battle is my home already. I don't care if we have been exiled.
Albeit my ancestors never fought in these lands, their spirits guide my blade nonetheless.
Victory or defeat, these are nothing. Only honor endures after death.
The taste of blood, it still lingers...
The battle calls.
We are the shield against Graggar… yet they let incompetent gods to tell the tales. The nine gods must be destroyed.
I have trained my entire immortal life for this moment, yet it feels so fleeting.
The sun rises... on another day of strife.
Ah yes... The wind whispers of battle once more.
